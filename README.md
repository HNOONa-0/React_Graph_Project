# Hello there!!
This app is about visualizing Graph data (as in Graph theory)


It's a small scale project that allows for simple & easy to use interface to interact with said graph just by writing text, i created this project inorder to help me properly visualize graph problems and understand them better, there are alot of similar tools such as CS Academy Graph editor


There is no backend for this project, the app won't remember data you typed, so, once you press refresh/close tab it will all be gone


It has 2 basic animations, Breadth First Search (BFS) & Depth First Search, But later down the road i plan on adding more complex algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for weightened graphs, more crisp animations & ways to better control those animations (reverse, pause & play and more), i also plan on making it more mobile friendly as currently its not supported for smaller screens


It's built with React js & Konva js, Konva is 2d canvas js library for desktop and mobile applications which also supports React, you can check the entire project out on Github repository link
Sorry if i dont display best of React or javascript practises, im new to React & web development, this is the first project i have created, i hope it doesn't disappoint
